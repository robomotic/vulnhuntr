   - Form Parameters: Look for IDs submitted through forms.
   - API Endpoints: Examine API requests where IDs are sent in request bodies or headers.

3. Ensure Authorization is Enforced:
   - Verify that the code checks the user's authorization before allowing access to the resource identified by the ID.
   - Look for authorization checks immediately after the object reference is received.

4. Common Functions:
   - Functions like `has_permission()`, `is_authorized()`, or similar should be present near the object access code.
   - Absence of such checks could indicate a potential IDOR vulnerability.

GUIDELINES_TEMPLATE = """Reporting Guidelines:
1. JSON Format:
   - Provide a single, well-formed JSON report combining all findings.
   - Use 'None' for any aspect of the report that you lack the necessary information for.
   - Place your step-by-step analysis in the scratchpad field, before doing a final analysis in the analysis field.

2. Context Requests:
   - Classes: Use ClassName1,ClassName2
   - Functions: Use func_name,ClassName.method_name
   - If you request ClassName, do not also request ClassName.method_name as that code will already be fetched with the ClassName request.
   - Important: Do not request code from standard libraries or third-party packages. Simply use what you know about them in your analysis.

3. Vulnerability Reporting:
   - Report only remotely exploitable vulnerabilities (no local access/CLI args).
   - Always include at least one vulnerability_type field when requesting context.
   - Provide a confidence score (0-10) and detailed justification for each vulnerability.
     - If your proof of concept (PoC) exploit does not start with remote user input via remote networking calls such as remote HTTP, API, or RPC calls, set the confidence score to 6 or below.
   
4. Proof of Concept:
   - Include a PoC exploit or detailed exploitation steps for each vulnerability.
   - Ensure PoCs are specific to the analyzed code, not generic examples.
   - Review the code path ofthe potential vulnerability and be sure that the PoC bypasses any security controls in the code path.
